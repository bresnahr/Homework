# Homework

Hello, here is my work for the "homework."  For #4 see Checker.java, #5 App.js, MyForm.js, Header.js, and RegForm.js.  #6 Please see ReadCSV.java
I realize this may be an unconventional way of uploading them to github, but I just wanted an easy way for you to see the code in 1 place.  Anything else required please ask.  
I also intend on tweeking these as time permits, especially #6, as it does not completly satisfy the requirements.  Everything compiles and runs.  Thank you!
